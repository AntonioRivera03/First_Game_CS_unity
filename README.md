<h1>Examples</h1>

<p>The point of the game is to weave in and out of rocks(circles) flying at you to try and reach a high level/score. Simple enough <br>This was my first game that I spent around an hour and a half on to create.
Also my first time using C#, however, my knowledge in Java made it so that I had to look up maybe three things about the language to write in it which is great.
Some things I didnt add which I will add when I come back to this are</p>
<li>Power ups</li>
<li>Restart game</li>
<li>Better assets</li>
<li>Bounds detection so the player can't go off screen (simple thing to add, need to wake up at 5am for work so will have to postpone) : )</li>

<p>This was primarily an introduction to Unity and c# as a whole so I am moving onto another progject regarding c# as I have enjoyed coding in it so far.</p>
